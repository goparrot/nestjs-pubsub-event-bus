# eslint by default ignores all hidden directories
# example, if you want lint hidden directories (also you must add ".storybook/**/*" to the tsconfig.eslint.json in the "include" property)
#!.storybook

# don't forget to add here all ignored folders or files from .gitignore that you don't need to check with a linter (there is no magic)
node_modules
dist
coverage
test-reports
.nyc_output

# add here all custom rules
